## Qiskit Collaboration Toolkit & AKLT Simulations

**Organization:** IBM & Qiskit Community  
**Duration:** January 2023 - November 2024  
**Location:** Remote

My spin-1 AKLT models directly led to the development and deployment of transmon qubit calibration codes in the Qiskit Community project (qiskit-collaboration).

- Implemented AKLT ground-state simulations on superconducting qubits
- Contributed to transmon qubit calibration methodology  
- Collaborated with the Qiskit Community on quantum circuit optimization
